# brackets-dusk-theme
Xcode's *Dusk* theme for Brackets. If you're using Atom, I highly recommend [dusk-syntax by James Espinosa](https://github.com/jamesejr/dusk-syntax).

###Installation
Download this repository as a zip, extract the zip file as a folder into `~/Library/Application\ Support/Brackets/extensions/user/` or other platform equivalent. An easy way to get here is by going to `Help > Show Extensions Folder` in Adobe Brackets.


###Original theme
Xcode's original *Dusk* theme is provided by Apple and built-in with Xcode. It can be found under the preferences menu. Here's what it looks like with some sample Swift code.
